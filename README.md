# Car-Animation
Looking forward for help with displayed Car animation ðŸ¤” in below UI because i want to know how it can be done,car mention in the screen should moves and follows the path and whenever it crosses a red  flag, the color of the flag changes to green. The car must reach the end of the path.  

Although i have applied a bit of animation but unable ðŸ˜£ to do the same mentioned above.

<h4>I have looked here and there and found that we can do the same with the help of Google Direction API but unbale to find any kind of reference on internet.</h4>
